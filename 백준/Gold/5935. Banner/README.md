### 문제 설명

<p>Bessie is returning from a long trip abroad, and Farmer John wants to erect a nice "Welcome Home" banner in her pasture for her arrival. The banner will hang between two poles on a wire whose length is in the range L1..L2 (1 <= L1 <= L2; L1 <= L2 <= 1,500).</p>

<p>The pasture's size is W x H (1 <= W <= 1,000; 1 <= H <= 1,000), and Farmer John has installed a post at every point with integer coordinates. Of these (W + 1) * (H + 1) points, Farmer John must pick just two that will hold either end of the wire from which he will hang the banner.</p>

<p>FJ wants no interference with his banner as it hangs and requires that no post be directly under the tight wire he stretches between the two chosen posts.</p>

<p>Farmer John needs your help to figure out how many possible ways he can hang the banner. He knows the number is large and that a 32-bit integer might not be sufficient to compute the answer.</p>

<p>Consider the example pasture below, with W = 2 and H = 1:</p>

<pre>       * * *
       * * *</pre>

<p>The banner size is in the range 2..3. This pasture contains (2+1) * (1+1) = 6 points and has (6 take 2) = (6*5)/(2*1) = 15 different potential pairs of points between which the banner-holding wire might stretch:</p>

<pre>   (0,0)-(0,1)   (0,0)-(2,1)   (0,1)-(2,1)   (1,1)-(2,0)
   (0,0)-(1,0)   (0,1)-(1,0)   (1,0)-(1,1)   (1,1)-(2,1)
   (0,0)-(1,1)   (0,1)-(1,1)   (1,0)-(2,0)   (2,0)-(2,1)
   (0,0)-(2,0)   (0,1)-(2,0)   (1,0)-(2,1)</pre>

<p>Of these pairs, only four have a length in the range 2..3:</p>

<pre>                     Len                       Len
        (0,0)-(2,0) 2.00          (0,1)-(2,0) 2.24 
        (0,0)-(2,1) 2.24          (0,1)-(2,1) 2.00 </pre>

<p>Of these four, the pairs (0,0)-(2,0) and (0,1)-(2,1) both have a post directly on the line between the endpoints, and thus are unsuitable.</p>

<p>So, just two pairs of points out of 15 are acceptable candidates for hanging the banner wire.</p>
